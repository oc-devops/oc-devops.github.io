  	  <h3>Once a Month or More</h3>
        <p>We meet once a month to share our knowledge and experiences to learn and discuss how to improve collaboration and sharing between teams while leveraging modern tools and high degrees of automation to build a better IT supply chain. We're just getting started, but plan of meetings to last 1-2 hours and to be focused on talks that demonstrate new tools, techniques and the companies that are using them to adopt DevOps.</p>
        <p>This is a group targeted to engineers and we welcome both developers and operations folks, tech professionals, managers and team leads, architects and entrepreneurs. We are all coming together to learn about and share information on DevOps processes, tools, practices and their far-reaching benefits.</p>
        <p>We welcome everyone and our organizers are friendly people. Feel free to read our <a href="http://www.ocdevops.org/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a></p>

      <h3>What is DevOps?</h3>
        <p>DevOps isn't something that you buy and not someone you can hire. It is a cultural movement; focused on building and operating high-performance organizations based on a set of core principles including sharing, measurement, and automation. If you are interested in learning more about what we are talking about, here are some really useful links to become aquainted with DevOps</p>
